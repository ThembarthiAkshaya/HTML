<!--Create an HTML page titled "Campus Map" that displays an image of a campus layout (campus.jpg).
 Make at least three clickable areas on the image:
A rectangle that links to "library.html" and represents the Library area of the campus.
A circle that links to "canteen.html" and represents the Canteen.
A polygon that links to "sports.html" and represents the Sports Ground.
Each area should have:
A proper alt description (e.g., "Library", "Canteen", etc.)
Correct shape and coords values.
A <map> element linked to the image using usemap.
Use placeholder coordinates (you can guess them) if you donâ€™t have a real image.
Add target="_blank" to all <area> tags to open the links in a new tab.-->
